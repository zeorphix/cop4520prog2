Problem 2: Minotaur’s Crystal Vase

- Approach
Strategy 1 is simple and allows for flexibility but lacks consistency. Since large guests could gather around the vase at one time, there is a higher chance for the vase to become accidentally broken, which we do not want at all.

Strategy 2 is a more sufficient implementation by using 'signs' to keep at most one guest in the room. This greatly decreases chances of the vase being broken, but still has no consistency, since guests could gather around the door waiting for the sign to turn back to 'AVAILABLE'.
